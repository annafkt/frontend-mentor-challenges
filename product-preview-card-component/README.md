## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Screenshot

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="screenshot-desktop.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the desktop layout"></td>
    <td><img src="screenshot-mobile.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the mobile layout"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## Problems and solutions

There was a little gap under the image, as if it had not filled its container properly.
The solution was to display it as a block element.
